    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    
    <p>This document is intended to be be one part of a bigger plan to improve the Open Web Platform testing process. It
       is a proposal to introduce a Test Coordinator as a new formal role in the W3C specification process and life
       cycle. This document will propose a definition of this role, including responsibilities, scope, limitations, and
       relationships to other W3C members, working groups, and to the broader Open Web Platform community.</p>

      NOTE: The specific word to use for the title role is not asserted in this proposal. For the purpose of this
      document, it will be referred to as the Test Coordinator. However, the actual name to use is open for nomination
      and discussion with some suggestions <a href="#role-name">below</a>

<section id="introduction">
    
    <h2><span class="secno">1. </span>Introduction</h2>
    <p>As the Open Web Platform grows, so does its complexity and the needs of broad community it serves. As such, the
       W3C and all of its subgroups must continually adapt and align common practices to best enable the community to
       deliver interoperable technology to the Web.</p>
    
    <p>The specification editor role is widely and formally recognized within the W3C as fundamental in creating and
       maintaining standards yet there is no corresponding role defined to ensure creation and maintenance of tests.
       Furthermore, in the current state of many emerging specs it is strongly apparent that more tests are needed for
       them. Therefore, a logical extension of roles and a solution to address the test deficits is to define a new role
       for test coordination. This is a proposal to introduce the Test Coordinator, a person who is publicly identified
       at the spec level to oversee test creation, review, delivery, and maintenance throughout the life cycle of a
       spec.</p>     
    
    <p>The following document outlines a detailed proposal for the definition, responsibilities and expectations for
       this role as well as suggested steps for implementation within the W3C.</p>
  
</section>
<section id="challenges">
    
    <h2><span class="secno">2. </span>Challenges</h2>
    <p>While some working groups and specs face more of these than others, the common challenges in test coordination
       are: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Many tests are needed, but it's unclear where to start or what needs to be done</li>
            <li>It's not easy to see what tests already exist and what coverage they provide</li>
            <li>The quality of tests varies</li>
            <li>There is a lack of reviewers, so getting tests approved can take a very long time</li>
            <li>Tests are not certified and delivered at regular intervals</li>
        </ol>
</section>
<section id="current-models">
    
    <h2><span class="secno">3. </span>Current Models</h2>
    <p>Some W3C working groups have already taken a similar approach for managing testing. In fact, this proposal is
       inspired by these working groups and aims to further articulate and standardize this role. The intention is t
       have a common set of practices across working groups so that the Open Web Platform test suites
       are created and delivered to implementors in a timely and cohesive way.</p>
    
    <p>Here are two examples of test coordination currently in practice:
    <h3><span class="secno">3.1 </span>WebApps Working Group</h3>
    <p>The WebApps Working Group has defined roles to manage test ownership and process for their group of specs. The
       roles (as defined <a href="http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/wiki/Approval">here</a>) are:
       <ul>
           <li><b>Test Facilitator</b> - the person(s) responsible for maintaining a specification's test suite,
                including: updating test cases, maintaining the test suite's status, etc. Normally, this role is 
                assumed to the specification's Editor(s). A Test Facilitator will be designated as the Default Assignee
                for the test suite's bug component in WebApp's Bugzilla database. Test Facilitators are expected to 
                work with Contributors e.g. to resolve quality issues, to eliminate redundant/overlapping asserts, etc.
           </li>
           <li><b>Testing Coordinator</b> - the person responsible for coordinating all of WebApps' testing efforts,
                including: assuring only approved tests are put in .../approved/ directories, making sure the test
                suites' statuses are current, etc. By default, this role is taken by a WG Chair, a WebApps Team Contact
                or a member of the WG. (In practice, this role may be shared by more than one person.)
            </li>
        </ul>
    <h3><span class="secno">3.2 </span>HTML5 Working Group</h3>
    <p>The HTML5 Working group has formed a 
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/wiki/TaskForces#Testing_Task_Force">Testing Task Force</a>,
         which meets bi-weekly and focuses on the development of tests.
</section>
<section id="proposal">
    
    <h2><span class="secno">4. </span>Proposal</h2>
    
    <p>This proposal builds upon the current models in practice and aims to elevate and formalize the test
       administration role across all W3C specifications and working groups. To clarify the role and to address the
       challenges listed <a href="#current-challenges">above</a>, the various aspects of this role are defined in 
       detail below.
    
    <section id="roledefinition">

        <h3><span class="secno">4.1 </span>Role Definition</h3>
        
        <p>The main intention for defining this entity is to distribute, delegate, and share responsibility among the
           people that have the expertise and the passionate desire for a high quality Open Web Platform.<p>
             
        <p>At a minimum, this role shall be generally defined as a publicly identifiable person who oversees, manages,
           and coordinates all testing efforts for an individual W3C specification. Within each working group, there
           shall be flexibility on the further detailing the definition of this role.  For example, as the
           specifications vary dramatically in size, impact and complexity, each spec needn't have just a single Test
           Coordinator; it may have as many Test Coordinators as desired by the working groups managing it.</p>
        
        <p>The duties assumed in this role may include any or all of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Engagement with the spec editors, the W3C, other Test Coordinators, and the community</li>
            <li>Subscriptions and participation on all relevant testing and spec W3C mailing lists</li>
            <li>Test coverage assessment for the spec</li>
            <li>Creation and maintenance of a public test outline defining all tests that are needed for the spec</li>
            <li>Monitoring backlog of tests awaiting review to ensure prompt approval</li>
            <li>Coordination of periodic delivery of certified test suite snapshots to implementors</li>
            <li>Participation in crowd-sourcing efforts, such as 
                <a href="http://testthewebforward.org/">Test The Web Forward</a>
            </li>
            <li>Contributing to documentation that enables newcomers to write high quality tests</li>
            <li>Recruitment of new test writers and test reviewers</li>
            <li>Continuous assessment of the testability of the spec</li>
        </ul>
        
        
    </section>
    <section id="scope">
    
        <h3><span class="secno">4.2 </span>Role Scope</h3>
        <p>The scope of this role is coordination of testing activity on the spec (or spec sections) to which this
            person is appointed. Testing activity may include (but is not limited to):
            <ul>
                <li>Test planning</li>
                <li>Authoring</li>
                <li>Reviewing</li>
                <li>Spec or feature-specific test documentation</li>
                <li>Test templates or sample tests</li>
                <li>Test coverage</li>
                <li>Feature-specific infrastructure</li>
            </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="limitations">

        <h3><span class="secno">4.3 </span>Limitations</h3>
        <p>While the person in this role may contribute directly to any of the testing activities mentioned above, it
           shall be clear that he or she is not solely responsible for them. In fact, direct contributions as a test
           author or reviewer (for example) need not be a requirement for this role. It may be that is purely to manage
           and coordinate others who are contributing directly to the test suites. 
        </p>
        <p>Also, this role shall not be considered as an editor of the specification. With the exception of the initial
        <a href="#implementation">implementation</a> period, the Test Coordinator's responsibilities are separate than
         those of the editors.</p>
    
    </section>
    <section id="relationships">
    
        <h3><span class="secno">4.4 </span>Role Relationships</h3>
        
        <p>As testing is an integral part of the Open Web Platform that impacts and aids many people, the Test
           Coordinator role shall be one that has relationships with all of the various stakeholders.</p>

        <section id="wg-members">
    
            <h4><span class="secno">4.4.1 </span>W3C</h4>
            <p>Each spec Test Coordinator shall have ongoing communication and participation with the W3C as efforts 
                are

                    underway
                </a>  at the W3C level to build and improve the test suites, framework, and infrastructure.  Therefore,
                 it is imperative that the Test Coordinators represent their specs and working groups as a constituency
                 as decisions are made along the way.</p>
    
        </section>
        <section id="spec-editors">
    
            <h4><span class="secno">4.4.2 </span>Spec Editors</h4>
            <p>Although the Test Coordinator shall be seen as a separate entity than the spec editor, the two roles
               shall have a symbiotic relationship. Just as the role of the Test Coordinator is to act as a catalyst 
               for bigger and better test suites, it shall also help improve the quality, clarity, and testability of
               the specifications. The spec Test Coordinator may look to the editors when testing efforts are 
               challenged or blocked due to issues with how the spec is authored. The spec editors may seek the
               assistance of the Test Coordinator when additional coverage is needed to advance a spec or resolve 
               an issue.</p>

        <section id="wg-members">
    
            <h4><span class="secno">4.4.3 </span>Working Group Members</h4>
            <p>Although not required, it is highly desirable that the test owner is an official member of the working
               group to which his or her appointed spec belongs. Similar to the relationship with the spec editors
               directly, the Test Coordinator may seek support from the broader working group when coordinating testing
               activities. Conversely, all testing status and progress shall be shared with the entire working group as
               advancements are made.</p>

        <section id="community">
    
            <h4><span class="secno">4.4.4 </span>Open Web Platform Community</h4>
            <p>Last, but perhaps most importantly, the Test Coordinator shall interface with the community to make
               contributing tests accessible and productive. Community participation in the advancement the Open Web
               Platform is vital to its success and quality. The Test Coordinators should recognize and utilize any of
               the myriad of ways through which to engage with the public.</p>

         <p>There may be controversy with whatever particular word is used in the title designating the Test
            Coordinator. This may be in part to the fact that individual words without contextual definitions may be
            misleading. This is yet another motivation for this thorough proposal and definition of role. Whatever word
            is chosen shall take on the meaning laid out in this document, which should assuage concerns or distaste 
            for otherwise misleading terms.</p>
         
         <p>That said, the official proposal for the name is to make the selection entirely democratic. Nominations 
            and preferences of all interested stakeholders shall be considered and the majority will prevail.</p>
         
         <p>Some suggestions (with supporting definitions):</p>

        <h3><span class="secno">4.6 </span>Implementation</h3>

        <p>This section of the document describes the proposal's implementation. If adopted, support and 
           acknowledgement from some key stakeholders will be very effective in rolling out the various pieces of 
           this new process.</p>
        
        <section id="w3c-acknowledgement">
    
            <h4><span class="secno">4.6.1 </span>W3C Acknowledgement</h4>
            <p>First and foremost, and since this is aimed to have some degree of consistency across the W3C, formal
               acknowledgement and acceptance from the W3C shall be the basis for the rest.  The degree to which the 
               W3C can facilitate or enforce its adoption should be discussed further and remain consistent with other
               W3C-wide processes.</p>
    
        </section>
        
        <section id="wg-acknowledgement">
    
            <h4><span class="secno">4.6.2 </span>WG Acknowledgement</h4>
            <p>At the next level, and in conjunction with the W3C, the working groups shall acknowledge this new role
               and agree to adopt at least a minimum set of its pieces. Where parts of this is already in place, full
               adoption may simply be designating Test Coordinators for all the specs that currently have none. The
               WGs shall also agree to adopt the same minimum set of pieces with the  possibility of further defining 
               an approach more tailored to their spec organization.  For example, the CSS Working Group manages a 
               large set of specs that are interrelated with one master spec representing the entire body of CSS 2.1 
               and many smaller specs for the respective CSS 3 features. It may be sensible to determine the division 
               of ownership based on logical groupings of closely related CSS specs.</p>

        <section id="spec-updates">
    
            <h4><span class="secno">4.6.3 </span>Spec Updates</h4>
            <p>A key part of this proposal is to have the Test Coordinator be publicly identifiable. Thus, the initial
               step in implementing the new role should include a modification to W3C spec template and header to list
               the Test Coordinator(s) immediately beneath the spec Editors.</p>

        <section id="selection">
    
            <h4><span class="secno">4.6.4 </span>Selection and Appointment</h4>
            <p>The Test Coordinators for each spec may be selected and appointed by the working groups and/or the spec
               editors. In the initial implementation phase, each spec shall have a Test Coordinator identified and may
               start as the editors themselves until the role is fill. Later, a more refined process for nominating and
               approving Test Coordinators may be further defined by the working groups.</p>

            <h4><span class="secno">4.6.5 </span>Common Tools and Materials</h4>
            <p>A set of common tools and materials to be used by Test Coordinators across all W3C specs may be created
               and shared to initiate the consistency of the role. Some of these things may be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A template for test outlines to publish along with the spec to define what tests are needed</li>
                <li>A test status report template</li>
                <li>A test coverage report template</li>

        <h3><span class="secno">4.7 </span>Measuring Success</h3>

        <p>As the initial steps to introduce this role are completed, the means to measure the success of the rollout
           may be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each W3C spec has a Test Coordinator identified</li>
            <li>Each W3C spec has been modified to include the Test Coordinator's name</li>
            <li>The Test Coordinators have agreed to collect a minimum amount of information on the status of
                testing for their specs</li>
            <li>A centralized location has been designated for containing the Test Coordinators common information</li>
        </ul>
